    <h3>Burger King Corporation is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Floridaâ€“based restaurant chain.<br>
         After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton  and James McLamore purchased the company in 1959 and renamed it "Burger King". Over the next half-century,<br>
          the company changed hands four times and its third set of owners, a partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, took it public in 2002. In late 2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company,<br>
           in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with partner Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons,
         under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.</h3>
